    - A Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) is employed to calculate the spanwise lift distribution of the wing for a specified aoa 
    or lift coefficient (C_L).
    - The VLM code also computes the induced drag coefficient (C_Di) using the Trefftz plane analysis, 
    which is a technique for analyzing the induced drag of a lifting surface.
