# A right-hand coordinate system is adopted as illustrated in Figure 2.1 below. The origin is set at the
# centroid of the wing box at the wing root, with the y-axis along the span, the x-axis parallel to the
# chord towards the trailing edge, and the z-axis vertically upwards


# The lifting structure shall have a maximum tip deflection of 15 \% 
# of the length of the lifting structure (of span) at the most critical loading condition
#The wing tip rotation should not exceed +/- 10 deg

----------------------------Initial assumptions--------------------------------------------

1. The wing box is assumed to be a cantilever beam, rigidly attached at the wing
root. This implies that the wing tip is free, and the loads at the tip are zero.

2. It is assumed that the shear center coincides with the centroid of the wing box
cross-section.

3. The wing is unswept, as initial 0.25c sweep is 0 deg. (Not really an assumption, but a note)

4. Area of one stringer assumed to be 200mm2, number of stringers is a variable and area is a constant.

5. All of the torque is carried by the sheets and spars,
and none by the stringers, meaning it is a conservative estimate of the torsional stiffness as in
reality the torque carried by the sheets and spars is higher.

6. It is assumed that the enclosed area Am can be approximated by the internal
area of the wing box as opposed to the area enclosed by the median line. This assumption will
result in a conservative estimate of torsional stiffness as, in reality, the enclosed area is larger. This assumption
is however considered valid as the thickness of the sheets and spars is small compared to the
internal dimensions, and therefore the enclosed area should not change much.
